1. As a user, I want to search for GIFs by keyword so that I can view a collection of relevant images.
2. As a user, I want the website to display GIFs in a grid format so that I can easily browse multiple GIFs at once.
3. As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that it looks good and works well on both desktop and mobile.
